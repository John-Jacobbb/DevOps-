‚úÖ Part 1: Introduction to Jenkins and CI/CD
üåê What is Jenkins?
Jenkins is an open-source automation server written in Java. It helps automate:

Building

Testing

Deploying your software

It supports Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) workflows.

‚úÖ Part 2: Prerequisites Before Jenkins Installation
Make sure the following are installed on your machine:

Component	Required Version	Purpose
Java (JDK)	8 or 11	Jenkins runs on Java
OS	Windows / Linux / Mac	Any modern OS works
Browser	Chrome/Firefox	To access Jenkins UI
Git	Latest	For CI projects using Git

üí° Tip: If using Ubuntu/Linux, keep your system updated using sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade

‚úÖ Part 3: Installing Jenkins (Ubuntu/Linux & Windows)
üëâ For Ubuntu/Linux:
Install Java:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk -y
java -version
Add Jenkins Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl -fsSL https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io.key | sudo tee \
  /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc > /dev/null

echo deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc] \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
Install Jenkins:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo apt update
sudo apt install jenkins -y
Start Jenkins:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo systemctl start jenkins
sudo systemctl enable jenkins
Access Jenkins:

Open browser and go to: http://localhost:8080

First time setup will ask for an admin password

Get Admin Password:

bash
Copy
Edit
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
üëâ For Windows:
Install Java (JDK 11)

Download from Oracle or use OpenJDK.

Set JAVA_HOME environment variable.

Download Jenkins:

Go to https://www.jenkins.io/download/ ‚Üí Windows.

Run the .msi installer.

Run Jenkins:

Jenkins will start as a Windows service.

Go to http://localhost:8080

Paste the admin password from:
C:\Program Files\Jenkins\secrets\initialAdminPassword

‚úÖ Part 4: Setting Up Jenkins Dashboard
1. Install Suggested Plugins
On first run, choose ‚ÄúInstall Suggested Plugins‚Äù.

It installs:

Git plugin

Pipeline plugin

GitHub integration

Build tools

2. Create First Admin User
Set username, password, full name, and email.

3. Jenkins Dashboard
You now land on the Jenkins dashboard.

It shows:

Job history

Build queue

Executors (parallel jobs)

System status

‚úÖ Part 5: Create Your First CI/CD Job
Let‚Äôs try a Freestyle Job (Basic CI):

Click on ‚ÄúNew Item‚Äù

Name it MyFirstCIBuild

Choose Freestyle Project

Under Source Code Management, select Git

Add GitHub repo URL (e.g., https://github.com/user/myapp.git)

Under Build, choose Execute Shell

bash
Copy
Edit
echo "Building project..."
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
Click Save and then Build Now

üéØ This is Continuous Integration ‚Äî every commit can trigger a build.

‚úÖ Part 6: Exploring Jenkins for Continuous Deployment (CD)
To extend into CD, you can:

Add a Post-build action like ‚ÄúDeploy to container‚Äù

Use a Pipeline Script (Jenkinsfile) like:

groovy
Copy
Edit
pipeline {
  agent any
  stages {
    stage('Build') {
      steps {
        echo 'Building the app...'
        sh 'javac App.java'
      }
    }
    stage('Test') {
      steps {
        echo 'Running tests...'
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
      steps {
        echo 'Deploying to production...'
        // Example: sh './deploy.sh'
      }
    }
  }
}
‚úÖ Part 7: Summary of CI/CD in Jenkins
CI/CD Step	Jenkins Feature Used
CI (Code Build + Test)	Freestyle project or pipeline stage
CD (Auto Deploy)	Post-build actions or deploy stages
Automation	Triggers: Git webhook, SCM polling
Monitoring	Console Output, Blue Ocean, Notifications

‚úÖ Next Steps:
Learn about webhooks to automate build on push

Explore Jenkins Pipeline as Code (Jenkinsfile)

Integrate tools like Docker, Ansible, or Kubernetes

✅ Easiest Fix: Use a Virtual Environment (Safe + Clean)
This avoids messing with your global Python installation and works 99% of the time.

🛠 Follow These Exact Steps:
1. Create Virtual Environment
In your terminal:
bash
Copy
Edit

python -m venv venv


2. Activate It
Run the right command based on your shell:
For PowerShell (your case):
bash
Copy
Edit

.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1


If using CMD:
bash
Copy
Edit

venv\Scripts\activate.bat


➡️ You should now see something like this at the beginning of your terminal:
scss
Copy
Edit
(venv) PS C:\Users\ASUS\Documents\My Games\DevOps-\flask-ci-cd-app>

3. Install Requirements (Inside venv)
Now install the packages without permission issues:
bash
Copy
Edit

pip install -r requirements.txt


✅ This will install everything in the local venv folder, not your system Python — so no more flask.exe.deleteme errors.

4. Run Your App
bash
Copy
Edit


python app.py


Then go to:
cpp
Copy
Edit
http://127.0.0.1:5000
5. (Optional) Run Tests
After stopping the app (Ctrl + C):

bash
Copy
Edit
pytest
If you’d like, I can create a simple one-click script (setup.bat) to automate all this in Windows. Would that help?

Sure! Below are the step-by-step instructions to run your Kubernetes-based containerized application using Visual Studio Code (VS Code):

🧩 Prerequisites Before You Start

Make sure the following are installed:

Node.js (v18+)

Docker

Minikube (or Docker Desktop with Kubernetes)

kubectl

Visual Studio Code (VS Code)

VS Code Extensions:

Docker

Kubernetes

YAML

🚀 Step-by-Step Guide to Run the Practical in VS Code

🟢 Step 1: Open the Project in VS Code

Extract the downloaded zip file: k8s-demo-app.zip

Open VS Code.

Go to File → Open Folder → Select the unzipped folder (k8s-demo-app).

✅ You should see the following files:

app.js

package.json

Dockerfile

deployment.yaml

service.yaml

🐳 Step 2: Build and Run Docker Image Locally (Optional Test)

Open the terminal in VS Code (Ctrl + `) and run:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker build -t k8s-demo-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 k8s-demo-app
Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to confirm it's working.

Press Ctrl+C to stop the container.

☁️ Step 3: Push Docker Image to Docker Hub (Once)

Login to Docker:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker login
Tag the image:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker tag k8s-demo-app your-dockerhub-username/k8s-demo-app
Push it:

bash
Copy
Edit
docker push your-dockerhub-username/k8s-demo-app
🌐 Replace your-dockerhub-username in deployment.yaml too!

☸️ Step 4: Start Kubernetes with Minikube

bash
Copy
Edit
minikube start
👀 To enable the Docker image from local system instead of Docker Hub (for dev):

bash
Copy
Edit
eval $(minikube docker-env)
docker build -t k8s-demo-app .
(Then update deployment.yaml to use image: k8s-demo-app)

📦 Step 5: Apply Kubernetes Manifests

In VS Code terminal:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
Expected Output:

bash
Copy
Edit
deployment.apps/k8s-demo-deployment created
service/k8s-demo-service created
🔍 Step 6: Access Your App

Get Minikube IP:

bash
Copy
Edit
minikube ip
Access in browser:

cpp
Copy
Edit
http://<minikube-ip>:30080
You should see: Hello from Kubernetes!

🧼 Step 7: Cleanup

To stop and delete everything:

bash
Copy
Edit
kubectl delete -f deployment.yaml
kubectl delete -f service.yaml
minikube stop

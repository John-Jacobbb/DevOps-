Great! Let’s now walk through a multi-stage Dockerfile for a Python app, step by step. This will help you optimize the final Docker image size, which is essential for faster deployment and better performance.

🐍 Simple Python App Example
Let’s assume this is your app structure:

perl
Copy
Edit
my-python-app/
│
├── app.py
├── requirements.txt
└── Dockerfile
🔹 app.py
python
Copy
Edit
print("Hello from Python multi-stage Docker build!")
🔹 requirements.txt
txt
Copy
Edit
# No external packages needed for this basic example
✅ Step-by-Step Guide to Create Multi-Stage Dockerfile
🔹 Step 1: Create a Dockerfile
Dockerfile
Copy
Edit
# -------- Stage 1: Build Stage --------
FROM python:3.12-slim AS build-stage

WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install dependencies into a temporary folder
RUN pip install --upgrade pip \
    && pip install --prefix=/install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

# -------- Stage 2: Production --------
FROM python:3.12-alpine AS production-stage

WORKDIR /app

# Copy installed Python packages from build stage
COPY --from=build-stage /install /usr/local
COPY --from=build-stage /app /app

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
🧾 Expected Output of This Step
✅ You should now have a Dockerfile in your app folder with two stages: one for building and one for running in a slim image.

🔹 Step 2: Build the Docker image
bash
Copy
Edit




docker build -t python-multistage-app .




  
🧾 Expected Output:
bash
Copy
Edit
[+] Building 5.7s (14/14) FINISHED
 => [internal] load build definition from Dockerfile
 => [internal] load .dockerignore
 => [build-stage 1/4] FROM python:3.12-slim
 => [build-stage 2/4] WORKDIR /app
 => [build-stage 3/4] COPY requirements.txt .
 => [build-stage 4/4] RUN pip install --prefix=/install ...
 => [build-stage 5/5] COPY . .
 => [production-stage 1/3] FROM python:3.12-alpine
 => [production-stage 2/3] WORKDIR /app
 => [production-stage 3/3] COPY --from=build-stage ...
 => exporting to image
 => => naming to docker.io/library/python-multistage-app
✅ Final line:

nginx
Copy
Edit
Successfully tagged python-multistage-app:latest
🔹 Step 3: Run the Docker container
bash
Copy
Edit






docker run --rm python-multistage-app





  
🧾 Expected Output:
bash
Copy
Edit
Hello from Python multi-stage Docker build!
🔹 Step 4: Check image size
bash
Copy
Edit





docker images





🧾 Expected Output:
REPOSITORY	TAG	IMAGE ID	SIZE
python-multistage-app	latest	abcd1234	~50MB
python	3.12	xyz98765	~120MB

✅ Image is much smaller due to multi-stage optimization.
